- To create a 30-60-90 day plan in the context of DevRel, you can follow the following guidelines:

1. The First 30 Days:
   - Learn about and establish connections with stakeholders such as colleagues from different teams (product, marketing, engineering, sales), external teams integrating with your protocol, and top builders within your community.
   - Have conversations to understand product differentiation, user personas, monetization strategy, and the maturity of the community.
   - Identify areas for improvement and opportunities to add value, such as outdated tutorials or missing information in the documentation.
   - Understand the organization's long and short-term strategy and align your DevRel strategy to complement and support those goals.
   - Set up a meeting with marketing to learn about the brand's tone and voice and understand any specific communication regulations.
   - Aim to achieve a small win or solve a blocker to boost confidence and demonstrate reliability.

2. Days 30-60:
   - Develop a deep understanding of the protocol and its stakeholders.
   - Assess how DevRel is perceived internally and educate stakeholders about the value DevRel brings to the organization.
   - Conduct a developer experience audit by putting yourself in the shoes of a developer and evaluating documentation, guides, code samples, and case studies.
   - Analyze competitors' products and identify areas to replicate or improve upon.
   - Share your findings with the product team and collaborate on improving the developer experience.
   - Document your experiences and share them internally and externally through social media or blog posts.

3. Days 60-90:
   - Increase communication and engagement with the community.
   - Identify areas where your expertise can support the DevRel team.
   - Prioritize activities that will bring the best returns.
   - Begin actively publishing content, such as blogs, case studies, podcasts, events, and social media activities.
   - Address the most urgent needs, especially in documentation.
   - Collaborate with the engineering team on improving documentation.
